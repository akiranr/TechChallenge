- The UI is a SPA built using the latest Angular hosted on AWS S3
- The back-end is an ASP.Net Core WebAPI running in a docker container on an AWS EC2 instance

New things learned from this exercise

- Took this opportunity to experiment with Docker and .Net Core
- The entire app is developed on a Linux machine running XUbuntu

Scope for improvement

 - Global error handling could be added to the web api project
 - In a real world scenario, aggressive caching goes a long way in improving the performannce. Cache store could be added
 - UI/UX can be improved
